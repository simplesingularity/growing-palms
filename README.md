Growing palm trees in zone 8A/B - Tried and tested methods

# Starting from seed (Chapter 1)
## Mold and ventilation
Always use a well ventilated area to deter mold such an exhaust fan especially if germinated indoors. A pouros media is recommended.

## Medium
Peat moss is not recommended because of the density and higher chances of mold. Use either coconut coir and perlite/vermiculite or moist spagnum moss.

## Fertility
The soil fertility must not be high. A sterile, infertile solution is acceptable, but it can also be ammended with a moderate amount of worm castings that add beneficial traces of fertilizer. Do not be in a haste to start fertilizing your seedlings, they will grow well without it as long as they have adequate light and water.

## Pests
Ensure that the seeds do not have the tiny palm weevil eggs attached to them (looks like sesame seeds but smaller). If they do, clean them thouroughly with soap and water and ensure all eggs are gone before proceeding. A dead giveaway that they may have weevil eggs are holes in the palm seed where the weevil ate at it.

## Light
As soon as your seeds emerge from their casing they are looking to grow downwards into soil and root themselves, and this mass may or may not react to sunlight and start turning green and producing leaves. So I recommend that you bury your seed at a proper depth to avoid the seed from putting out leaves too quickly or you will have a spindly or small plant. Then as the first leaf starts to emerge it will need adequete sunlight.

## Types and temperature
Some palms require heat to germinate, others require *ambient room temperature (e.g. 70-72 degrees). Here are some examples of palms that need different requirements:
* Pindo palm (Butia Odorata), bottom or top heat, moist, straight perlite medium to prevent rot (2 weeks this way)
* Chinese windmill palm (Trachycarpus Fortunei), ambient room temp* or colder, moist medium such as coco coir
* Trunking Sabal palm (Sabal Palmetto), ambient room temp* or hotter, moist medium such as coco coir mixed with perlite to prevent molding
* Sylvester date palm (Phoenix Sylvestris), moist medium such as coco coir mixed with perlite to prevent molding

# Growing in a container (Chapter 2)
## Pot
Ensure that your pot is not more than 10% bigger than the root mass of your seedling/plant or it may sit in water and rot. Ensure that there is proper drainage holes in your pot. If there is not sufficient drainage, drill holes around the bottom of the pot, around the sides, not just under as water can easily get trapped depending on where your pot sits.

## Fertility
At this point I'm assuming you have at least two leaves on your seedling. If not I would recommend waiting some. The fertilizer in this pot should be a (very) slow release as they are evergreens, full coverage (NPK and magnesium and manganese, iron, zinc, copper, silica, boron, etc.). Less fertilizer is more when it comes to pots as the nitrogen salts build up fast, especially if you have poor draining medium. An alternative to the inorganic route is using a fertile soil such as compost (I have used worm castings with much success) mixed with topsoil and some sand for minerals. If you decide to go the organic route then it may be wise to add some existing soil from the ground/lawn in your mix to provide some minerals.

## Medium
I have used anything from pinebark to topsoil and sand mixtures. The palms are not very picky as long as the soil will drain. Poly coated slow release fertilizer is used in combination with a well draining and/or otherwise infertile medium to achieve a good potting mix. 

# Planting your palm tree from a pot
## Site
Choose a site with full sunlight unless you have an understory type palm tree. For Pindo palms in heavy clay soil you may dig a circle 2 feet away and around your palm tree and backfill with gravel to create a simulated well draining soil. They will thrive this way and I have even revived dying Pindo palms this way.

## Planting
Ensure that you have dug the site deep enough and fill back the soil so that the roots have soft soil to grow into downwards. This will make your palm grow taller and stronger than ever. Do not amend the soil when planting your palm tree, and ensure to water it frequently after planting.

## Fertilization schedule
Do not fertilize your palm trees until May 1st. Most palm trees will not use the fertilizer until the weather has stabilized and it may even be hurt by early fertilization. I recommend plant spikes with NPK+micro and macro or alternatively an organic bag of essentially bone meal mixture for palm trees. Unless you live in a subtropical climate that does not get very cold in the wintertime, do NOT use a slow release fertilizer at this point. You do not want active nitrogen in the soil during winter time in zone 8A/B because it will cause more damage and rot to the tree.
